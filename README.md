# Caesar Cipher

A C# Windows Forms App exercise project, developed during my retraining as an IT Specialist in Application Development at Lutz + Grub Academy. This simple application implements the Caesar Cipher encryption method, allowing users to both encrypt and decrypt text.

Additionally, the program supports saving the encrypted result to a `.json` file and loading it back later.

## Features

- Caesar encryption and decryption (offset +2)
- Input and output via GUI
- Save encrypted result to file
- Load encrypted result from file (JSON-based)

## How to Run

To run the Windows Forms App program directly, launch `Caesar Cryptography.exe` located in `bin/Release/net6.0-windows`.

**The code was written independently by me. The class only provided a general idea of what the project should do.**
