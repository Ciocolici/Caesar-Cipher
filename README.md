# Caesar-Cipher
A C# (CSharp) Windows Forms App exercise-project, done during my classes for IT Specialist in Application Development by Lutz & Grub Academy. A simple Caeser Cipher, that encrypts and decrypts. The program can also save the encrypted result, and load it later.

*To run the Windows Forms App program directly, launch "Caesar Cryptography.exe" located in "bin/Release/net6.0-windows".*
